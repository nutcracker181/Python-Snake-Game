# Python Snake Game

Snake is a classic arcade game where you control a growing line, or "snake," as it moves around the screen. The goal is to collect food items that appear on the screen, which makes the snake grow longer. As the snake grows, navigating becomes increasingly challenging because you must avoid crashing into walls or the snakeâ€™s own tail. The game ends if you collide with an obstacle or yourself. It's a test of reflexes and strategy, with the aim of achieving the highest score possible. The simplicity and addictive nature of Snake have made it a timeless favorite across various platforms, from early mobile phones to modern gaming systems.
